# Rival-Studio
A tool to help make characters for Rivals of Aether Workshop, made with Godot Engine.

Currently the tool can offset sprites. More features are planned, including:
- **Animating moves:** Animate windows, hitboxes and other stuff without touching any text file
- **Generate hurtboxes automatically:** Cloning a sprite and painting it green is so simple a machine can do it
- **Edit config.ini:** How else is anyone supposed to know how your character works?
- **Also edit init.gml:** So you don't have to refresh the game every 5 seconds
- **Make alternate color palettes:** By that we mean funny references to other media

You can find the latest release in the *releases* page.

Feel free to make issues or even pull requests :)
